About
======

Hello :\) I am Erica, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Operations Research within the Department of Management Science & Engineering (MS&E) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Jose H. Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche/) (MS&E) and Prof. [Mert Pilanci](https://stanford.edu/~pilanci/) (Electrical Engineering). I am also grateful to be supported by the [Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF) in Sciences and Engineering](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf), generously sponsored by the [Koret Foundation](https://koret.org/grantees/cross-disciplinary-research-stanford-university/).

As part of my Ph.D., I recently completed a co-enrolled M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering (2025), specializing in Control & Optimization. Prior to Stanford, I earned a dual B.A. in Mathematics and Statistics from [Columbia College, Columbia University](https://www.college.columbia.edu/), graduating *summa cum laude* with honors from both departments.

*This summer, I’m excited to be interning as an Applied Scientist working on Generative AI with [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) at the Bellevue office.*

*Happy to share that our paper, "Empirical martingale projections via the adapted Wasserstein distance," is accepted at Annals of Applied Probability!*

Research
======
My research lies at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and machine learning. As a theorist and statistician, I am particularly interested in revisiting and repurposing classical techniques from probability and optimization theory to tackle modern learning challenges, with a focus on improving sample efficiency in large-scale, high-dimensional settings.

Recently, my work has focused on the principled integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional learning pipelines, leveraging their capacity to augment statistics-driven models with rich contextual metadata, while preserving tunability, robustness, and statistical rigor.

Philosophically, I’m inspired by mathematician [Hans Hahn's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Hahn_(mathematician)) view of mathematics as a precise, elegantly constructed conceptual framework: one that enables us to abstract information and perform tautological transformations to uncover fundamental laws governing our world <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. As I continue journey as a researcher, I hope to uncover more of these hidden structures within learning systems through the lenses of optimization and statistical theory and push the frontiers of what we can rigorously understand and design in machine learning.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my work 🙂
